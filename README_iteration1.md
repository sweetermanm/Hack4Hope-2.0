Hack4Hope Community Forum Iteration 1 update:

Our application has been built on a java platform with .jsp files that hold and
run all our webpages. To run the package, you will need to have installed a
running version of an apache tomcat server that will run on your local machine.
We are currently using apache tomcat webserver 8.5. Then you will need to download
the Java EE web content package from the Eclipse website. From there you should
switch your eclipse version to web content and run any of the .jsp files on the server.
This will launch and run the application. You should be able to run these pages
and navigate between them while the application is running on the local host.
We are looking into potentially hosting the application on AWS. For now, we
currently have test scripts running on sign up and homepage to pull all the posts
and users from the database. If you would like access the database, which is hosted
on IX Web Hosting and uses phpMyAdmin to edit the MySQL database. If you would like
access to this database, please contact Emma and she will create a login for you.
