Background
  
  In July 2015, Hack4Hope held their first hackathon for underserved youth in the St. Louis community. After the hackathon,
  the Hack4Hope team created the Hack4Hope Academy to help further students learning over the course of a year. Both the
  annual hackathons and Hack4Hope Academy serve as a way to unite the youth of St. Louis with adult developers and innovator
  with a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. The main goals of Hack4Hope, listed on their website, are:
    
    To further develop students’ cognitive abilities to rapidly engineer a problem-solving technology product
    
    To provide students with mentorship from adult professionals, guiding them with tangible pathways toward success
    
    To involve students in an immersive high growth entrepreneurial process that both connects them to a strong STEAM
      foundation  and prepares them to tell their story and articulate their experiences to a wide audience
    
    To address problem-solving inclusive issues surrounding community relations specific to the St. Louis Metro Area
    
    To offer pre-college experience with a lifelong impact

Customer
  
  The customers for this software project are the Co-Founders of Hack4Hope, Nicole Franklin and Aimee Krummenacher. I
  volunteered with this organization at the first hackathon and have continued my involvement from Cincinnati, developing a
  strong relationship with the founders over the years. As Aimee is a relative, she is easily reachable. She also works from
  Cincinnati one week a month which makes it possible to have in-person meetings with her if necessary to help refine the
  specifications and requirements.

Problem
  
  After the hackathon, students are enrolled in the Hack4Hope Academy. While this offers in- person meetings and online
  activities, there is little interaction between the students and mentors outside of these planned events. Nicole and Aimee
  are looking for a way to increase this communication. They hope that this communication will encourage the students to get
  more involved and engaged in continuing to learn about coding. Another goal Nicole and Aimee are wish to accomplish is to
  provide a way for students to learn from each other and their mentors outside of the "classroom."
  
Solution
  
  After speaking with Aimee about the problem they are facing and the goals they hope to accomplish, I proposed that we build
  an online forum, similar to the Canvas discussion boards, that allows students and mentors to login and post questions,
  responses, and any other interesting information they want to share with their peers. A forum like this would continue
  discussions outside of in-person meetings and assist students who run into problems while working on their programming
  projects.
  
  Basic Features
  
    Database of users and posts/comments
    User login authentication
    Ability for user to post in the forum and comment on other user's posts
    Clean user interface for viewing discussion posts and comments
    Webpage that can be scaled down for mobile viewing
 
 Secondary Features
 
    Ability to edit account information
      Add a picture
      Add profile information
      Change password
    Ability to post in topics/on boards
      Separate page for each topic and navigation menu to move between boards
    Ability to attach files to a post

Testing/Demo

  While this solution is somewhat social in design, I believe that it can be tested with a small group of users, like our
  project teams. Hack4Hope currently does not have anything like this and would if they are happy with the results of the
  project, they would implement it slowly, allowing a small number of students to use it before opening it up to everyone. We
  could simulate this type of use with testing in our project group.

  This project can be demonstrated by allowing other students in class to create an account, log in, and post on the
  discussion forum. This will allow for an active and engaging demonstration that gives the attendees a chance to see what
  the project can do first hand and play around with the different features that are offered.

Justification

  I believe that this proposal is a great idea for this class because it is a feasible idea with a set of basic features that
  a group of 5-7 students can work on over the course of the semester. The primary features will help encourage communication
  outside of the hackathon and Hack4Hope Academy activities and address the problem that Hack4Hope's founders are seeing.
  There are also secondary features that can be incorporated into the project if additional time remains. These features will
  add more to the user experience of this site if added to the project. In addition to these features, the overall product
  will be beneficial to the students Hack4Hope serves, who may turn out to be the next generation of programmers.
