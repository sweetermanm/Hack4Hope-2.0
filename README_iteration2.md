Hack4Hope Community Forum Iteration 1 update:

Our web app is hosted on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance.  To interact with and test our web app, go to testingh4h-env.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com.  If you want to run any of the tests we have written, you will need to clone our repository and open the project in Eclipse.  After this, simply go to the src/testing/test and run.  All 3 of the tests in this testing class should pass.
